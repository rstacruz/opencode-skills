# OpenCode Skills Plugin

**Note:** this is my personal fork of https://github.com/malhashemi/opencode-skills - docs to follow!

Differences:

- Less strict about paths
- Uses less context (usually)
- Can work with skills that don't specify steps (eg, superpowers)
- Less verbose logging
- Support for ~/.config/opencode/skills/
